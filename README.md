# Weather-Dashboard

This simple weather dashboard allows you to search for the weather in your city via Open Weather One Call API. 

From here, you will get a weather forcast for the day, as well as the next 5 days. 

Your previous searches will be saved in the local storage for ease of access upon your return.
